Whenever it comes to board games, the first thing that comes to mind is ways to win.

To say it in one word; strategy.

In order to win, a player will have to choose a strategy and more often than not switch to another strategy based on the opponentâ€™s move and board setting.

How might we play this game?

Play in an open square
Play to an open corner
How can we stay in the game?

Block the opponent from winning
How can we win the game?

Place a third piece in a row to win
Based on this behaviour of the system, we can incorporate the Strategy Pattern
