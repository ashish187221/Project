The purpose of playing Tic-Tac-Toe is to win by getting 3 of your marks (either X or O) in a straight line.
The straight line can run diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. 
In some versions of the game, the objective is slightly different. For instance, a game of 16-square Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a grid of 4 x 4 squares.
In this type of game, the game can be won by placing 4 marks in a straight line or diagonal line or placing 4 marks in a diamond or square shape. 
In short, the purpose of the game is determined by which variation of the game you are playing.
